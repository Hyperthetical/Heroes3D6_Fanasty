\label{sec:spells}

In order to use spells you need to have unlocked them by being taught the spell via a book or master wizard. Otherwise a character can learn a spell themselves by paying the experience point cost of 3 (augment, or alternative effects cost further 3 each). No spells can be learned unless the character has the \textlf{arcane learning} perk. The \textlf{difficulty} of the casting check for each spell is given in square brackets after its name.

\subsection{Accusation [9]}
You accuse a target creature of some misdeed, all nearby creatures become suspicious that the accusation is true if they fail a \textlf{Resist(R)} check.
\subsubsection{Augment: Denouncement}
The target of Accusation is subject to the \textlf{Cripple} effect for 1 round and 1 additional round per level of \textlf{critical failure} on \textlf{resist}.


\subsection{Animate homunculus [13]}
You can shape a small creature out of any given material (30 cm is the maximum size), this creature is then animated and can be directly controlled by you (this requires your full concentration). The creature will only act when controlled, otherwise it remains inert. A homunculus uses your \textlf{Magic} proficiency for all skill checks, but cannot inflict damage in combat.
\subsubsection{Augment: Automaton}
Your homunculus is always animated and will obey simple verbal commands. You may have 1 + \textlf{perception} homunculi active at once. 
\subsubsection{Augment: Golem [15]}
The maximum size of your homunculi is increased to medium (man-sized) creatures, these can wield weapons and make unarmed attacks in combat.


\subsection{Arcane armour [11]}
\label{spell:arcane-armour}
For 1 action point you envelope yourself in a bubble of force. This makes your base \textlf{Toughness} $9$ + \textlf{Magic} skill. This lasts for 10 minutes and is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect.
\subsubsection{Augment: Hardened magic}
Damage rolls against you suffer an \textlf{edge} penalty while this spell endures.


\subsection{Arcane wall [12]}
For 1 action point you create a wall of arcane force around a radius of 6 m (1 combat area) within a range of 3 (40 m). Passing through the wall costs any creature 1 action point and requires a \textlf{resist(M)} check, failure means they cannot traverse the wall and suffer damage with normal \textlf{lethality} (\textlf{critical success} for the caster on the \textlf{resist} increments the damage severity). This lasts for 10 minutes and is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect.


\subsection{Bend light [12]}
\label{spell:bend-light}
You can bend the rays of light to create minor illusions, altering the appearance of an object or making a creature/object up to medium size invisible while it is stationary. Anyone looking at this effect must \textlf{resist(W)} to decide if they are fooled. This is a \textlf{persistent} effect.
\subsubsection{Augment: Major illusion [14]}

\subsection{Blinding ray [10]}
\label{spell:blind-ray}
You can focus light, from a given source you touch, into a bright beam. This \textlf{blinds} a victim that fails a \textlf{resist(R)} check, additionally the normal lighting from the light source is removed for 1 round but the area adjacent to the target is fully illuminated for this time. The blindness lasts 1 additional round per level of \textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist}.


\subsection{Compel [13]}
You ensnare the target's mind forcing them to make an action chosen by you if they fail a \textlf{Resist(W)} check. This fails if the action would harm the target. This is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect. Specify one extra action per level of \textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist}. The victim is aware that they being forced to act.

For 1 action point you curse a target creature. If they fail a \textlf{resist(R)} check then they replace any 6's they roll (on single d6's) with 1's. This lasts for 10 minutes and  is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect.


\subsection{Earthquake [13]}
For 2 action points you choose a region of radius 6 m radius (1 combat area) within a range of 3 (40 m) and make the ground violently shake. All creatures in the area must \textlf{resist(M)} or be knocked down. This can be maintained as a \textlf{persistent} spell for up to 1 minute.

\subsection{Fear [11]}
A cloud of fear passes across the target's mind if they fail a \textlf{resist} check, meaning they cannot approach the caster or remain adjacent to them for 1 minute. Each round after the first the victim may re-attempt the \textlf{resist(R)}. 
\subsubsection{Augment: Terror}
You have learned to afflict the mind with absolute terror. The target of fear must additionally make an immediate Courage check or suffer an \textlf{edge} penalty to all rolls while this effect persists. 


\subsection{Flare [11]}
\label{spell:flare}
Invoking a secret sign of power you cause a single flame to burst into in blinding white flash. Anyone who can see the flare is \textlf{blind} for 1 round and 1 additional round per level of \textlf{critical failure} on \textlf{resist(M)}. The explosion of the flare itself is harmless.
\subsubsection{Augment: Burning flare}
Flare ignites all adjacent creatures, who suffer damage with normal \textlf{lethality} if they failed \textlf{resist} (\textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist} increments damage severity).


\subsection{Fireball [11]}
This costs 2 action points and unleashes an explosive fireball that strikes a 6 m radius (1 combat area) within a range of 3 (40 m). Creatures within the blast must make a \textlf{resist(C)} check or suffer damage with normal \textlf{lethality} (\textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist} increments damage severity). This spells sets all flammable material in the radius on fire.
\subsubsection{Augment: Blaster Master [13]}
Reduce the cost to 1 action point.


\subsection{Glacial ray [12]}
This costs 2 action points. A ray of ice strikes a target within range 3 (40 m). If they fail a \textlf{resist(C)} check they are \textlf{immobilised} and \textlf{vulnerable} until damaged.

Glacial ray applies its effects to all creatures adjacent to the primary target.
\subsubsection{Augment: Deep-freeze}
After the effect of Glacial ray ends the ice shatters causing all creatures adjacent to the target take a hit with normal \textlf{lethality}.


\subsection{Guided motion [10]}
Your command motion allows you to reach out and enhance the movements of another body. This confers an \textlf{edge} bonus to an allied target's next \textlf{Athletics} or \textlf{deflect} check. Choose one extra ally per level of \textlf{critical success} when casting.
\subsubsection{Alternate: Inhibit motion [11]}
Guided motion can target an enemy and confer an \textlf{edge} penalty instead if they fail a \textlf{resist(M)} check.


\subsection{Hex of weakness [13]}
For 1 action point you hex a target creature. If they fail a \textlf{resist(R)} check, then whenever they lose \textlf{endurance} they lose 1 additional point. This lasts for 10 minutes and  is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect.

Creatures within the area suffer a hit with normal \textlf{lethality}. For 10 minutes the area is \textlf{rough terrain}, anyone entering the area suffers a hit with normal \textlf{lethality}. This is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect.
\subsubsection{Augment: Sub-zero [13]}
The cost of this spell is reduced by 1 action point.


\subsection{Ignite [10]}
\label{spell:ignite}
Knowledge of natural secrets allows you to liberate energy from objects, causing them to burn. This spell sets the target on fire, however, the target can only be ignited if it is flammable. The fire created by Ignite also suffers from normal physical restrictions., i.e. You may not set fire to a creature unless it is naturally flammable, covered in oil, or circumstantially vulnerable. Setting fire to the clothes of a foe does no great harm to him (it might cause weak enemies to panic).


\subsection{Illuminate [8]}
\label{spell:illuminate}
A single small object you touch begins to glow softly. This provides low-light illumination over a single combat area (around a 6 m radius). This lasts until you cancel it.


\subsection{Imbued rune [*]}
For 1 action point you create a magical rune that contains a spell you know. This spell will be triggered when a condition you specify on casting the rune occurs. The rune lasts 1 hour and only one rune can be active at a time. The \textlf{difficulty} is the same as the imbued spell's +2 .


\subsection{Iron arm [11]}
For 1 action point a chosen ally has +2 \textlf{power}, this is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect. Choose an additional ally per level of \textlf{critical success} when casting.


\subsection{Lightning strike [11]}
For 2 action points a bolt of lighting strikes a target within range 3 (40 m). The target must \textlf{resist(C)} or suffer damage with crushing \textlf{lethality}. The strike ignites all flammable material within 6 m (range 0).
\subsubsection{Augment: Arcing [12]}
If Lightning strike causes injury to the target, a second target, within range 1 (12 m) of the primary target, may be selected for the spell at no action point cost. 


\subsection{Mimic sound [8]}
Your dexterity with the words of the wind allow you to mimic any chosen sound. The convincingness of this is decided by results of listeners' \textlf{resist} checks.


\subsection{Mind blast [12]}
For 1 action point you blast a 6 m radius (1 combat area) within a range of 3 (40 m) with psychic energy. All creatures in the area must \textlf{resist(W)} or gain an instance of the \textlf{Stagger} effect, with 1 additional instance per level of \textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist}. This does not affect \textlf{mindless} creatures.
\subsubsection{Augment: Mind scour}
If cast with 2 action points you inflict damage with normal \textlf{lethality} on victims who failed \textlf{resist} (\textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist} increments damage severity).


\subsection{Minor telekinesis [9]}
\label{spell:min-tele}
You have learned the words and signs that control the fundamental motions of the world. This allows you to exert the force of a single hand to perform simple actions on an object visible to you.
\subsubsection{Augment: Major telekinesis [11]}
This relaxes restrictions on the casters telekinetic abilities, allowing the caster to manipulate an object up to a maximum weight of 20 kg per point of \textlf{perception}. If the object is used as a weapon, it uses the caster's \textlf{Magic} proficiency for \textlf{aim}. The bonus \textlf{Power} of such a weapon is given by the excess lifting force of the spell (that not required to actually move the object):  + 1 per 10 kg excess. The \textlf{power} for grabbing objects is calculated in the same manner. If multiple objects are controlled, the Power bonus from excess lifting force may be divided between them at the caster's discretion. This control lasts as longer as the caster can maintain his concentration.


\subsection{Orb of light [8]}
\label{spell:orb-light}
For 1 action point create a floating orb of light that can move a distance of 12 m (range 1) each turn. The orb provides full illumination within 6 m (1 combat area) of itself and \textlf{low} light within 12 m (radius 1).


\subsection{Overgrowth [9]}
\label{spell:overgrowth}
For 1 action point you choose a region of radius 6 m radius (1 combat area) within a range of 3 (40 m) and make plant growth explode from the ground. This region is now \textlf{rough terrain}.


\subsection{Paths of nature [9]}
Your secret knowledge has opened you to the voice of nature, this spell allows the caster to ignore natural forms of \textlf{rough} or \textlf{dangerous terrain} effects as well as an \textlf{edge} bonus on \textlf{stealth} and \textlf{awareness} checks while in wilderness. This lasts for 1 hour.
\subsubsection{Augment: Woodland whispers}
You can understand and speak the languages of plants and trees.
\subsubsection{Augment: Tongues of beasts}

At any point within the next 24 hours you may replace any 3d6 roll (made by any creature or character) with the 3d6 you set aside. You may only have one such set of predicted dice available at once. On a \textlf{critical failure} to cast the GM may instead choose when to make the roll substitution.
\subsubsection{Augment: Forecasting}
You can store 2 predictions at once.


\subsection{Pyrokinesis [9]}
With secret signs and forgotten knowledge you can transport the energies of a fire (flame and/or just heat) wherever you wish within a range 2. 


\subsection{Root lore [12]}
Forgotten knowledge of plants and roots allows you to call on their assistance to entrap foes. Provided there are plants or other natural growths nearby, this can be used to make roots \textlf{grapple} or \textlf{shove} a chosen enemy within the foliage. The roots use your \textlf{magic} power score when making opposed checks. This is a \textlf{persistent} spell effect.
\subsubsection{Augment: Bushwhack [14]}
Plants and roots can be made to strike at your foes, using your \textlf{Magic} skill proficiency for \textlf{aim}. For two action points you can instead activate a tree to strike at a nearby foe, this attack has crushing \textlf{lethality}.


\subsection{Shadow [13]}
You cause all lights in within a chosen radius of 1 (around 13 m) to go out and thick shadow clouds the area. Creatures within the region fight using the \textlf{dark} lighting rules. This lasts until you cancel it.


\subsection{Sleep [10]}
This costs 1 action point and is a \textlf{persistent} spell. A single target within range 3 (40 m) must \textlf{resist(R)} or fall asleep for 10 minutes. Any attacks or damage end the sleep. 
\subsubsection{Augment: Field [12]}
If used for 2 action points this spell affects all creatures within a radius of 6 m (1 combat area).


\subsection{Sorcerous blast [8]}
\label{spell:sorc-blast}
This costs 1 action point and fires a missile whose type is chosen from among fire/lightning/force/ice. If cast successfully, the target must \textlf{resist(C)} or suffer damage with normal \textlf{lethality} (\textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist} increments damage severity). This does not occupy an active \textlf{perk} slot, it counts as basic attack and thus can only be cast once per turn.


\subsection{Sow doubts [9]}
Your withering words instil doubt and uncertainty into a target that fails a \textlf{Resist(R)}, causing them an \textlf{edge} penalty on their skill checks. This lasts 1 minute, each round after the first the victim may re-attempt the \textlf{resist}. 
\subsubsection{Augment: Sap will}
Victims of your Sow doubts now also suffer an \textlf{edge} penalty to their \textlf{Resist} checks.
\subsubsection{Augment: Air of doubt [11]}
Sow doubts affects all chosen creatures adjacent to the primary target.


\subsection{Stone sense [9]}
\label{spell:stone-sense}
Your expert knowledge of vibrations allows you to extend your hearing through a continuous stone (or earthen) surface or structure. For this purpose, a wall of stone bricks is continuous but soil and dirt do not count (they do not conduct vibrations coherently enough). 
\subsubsection{Augment: Shape earth [13]}
A cunning earthen sigil allows the caster to twist the very earth into any shape he desires. The caster may touch earth or stone and then manipulate up to 10 kg of earth, or 5 kg of stone, plus 10 kg earth or 5 kg stone per point of \textlf{Perception}. The material may be manipulated into any shape the caster desires.


\subsection{Stone skin [12]}
By touch you draw stone from the ground to clad you in armour. For 1 round damage rolls against you suffer a \textlf{lethality} downgrade (to a minimum of normal). 
\subsubsection{Augment: Earth-clad}

\subsection{Suggestion [10]}
Make a single-sentence suggestion of an action to the target, on a failed \textlf{Resist(W)} check they follow the suggestion willingly. This suggestion will automatically fail if it would
be harmful to the victim themself or their friends/allies. Specify 1 additional suggestion per level of \textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist}. 		
\subsubsection{Augment: Manipulation [12]}
Your mastery of the voice allows you to implant beliefs or feeling into a target via suggestion. In addition suggestion no longer fails if it would be harmful to the victims friends/allies.


\subsection{Summon familiar}
\label{spell:familiar}
You summon a magical familiar to you, this is a very small creature (e.g. rat, cat, bird, lizard, frog, hedgehog, squirrel). The form of the creature is changeable and it takes 10 minutes of concentration to change its form. You can communicate telepathically with the creature while it is within 30 m of you. Additionally, you can view the sensory perceptions of the creature instead of your own while it is within 30 m of you (you are blind and deaf to your own senses while doing this). This spell occupies a passive \textlf{perk} slot.


\subsection{Time warp [14]}
For 1 action point choose a creature within range 3 (40 m) to either gain or lose an action point each turn until the effect ends (maximum duration 1 minute). Targets may \textlf{resist(R)} each turn to end the effect. Only one action point may be gained or lost each turn in this way. \textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist} means the target cannot attempt \textlf{resist} next turn.
\subsubsection{Augment: Field}
If used for 2 action points this spell affects all creatures within a radius of 6 m (1 combat area).


\subsection{Transfix [10]}
\label{spell:transfix}
You twist the target's perceptions, entranced or bewildered by confusing mental imagery they are forced to be stationary and motionless for 1 minute, if they fail a \textlf{Resist(W)} check (1 additional minute per level of \textlf{critical success} for the caster). If attacked, the effect ends. 
\subsubsection{Augment: Paralysis}
Your transfixing gaze renders the target completely incapable of action. Transfix continues for 1 round after the target is attacked or damaged.


\subsection{Twist the wind [11]}
A complex incantation allows you to produce a localised air vortex that escapes outwards with a booming crash. This \textlf{Staggers} all creatures within a chosen area if they fail a \textlf{resist(R)} check.
\subsubsection{Augment: Thunderous blast [12]}
The normal effects of Twist the wind now additionally inflict damage with normal \textlf{lethality} on victims if they failed \textlf{resist} (\textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist} increments damage severity).


\subsection{Warp space [14]}
For 1 action point you can twist the fabric of spacetime to move a target creature, which can attempt to \textlf{resist(C)} if it wants to. This moves the target a distance up to range 3 (40 m). This cannot affect targets more than 1 size category larger than the caster without 1 level of \textlf{critical success} for the caster on \textlf{resist} per size additional category difference.


\subsection{Weather sense}
You are attuned to the whispers of the sky and thus can predict the weather up to 1 day + \textlf{perception} in advance.
\subsubsection{Augment: Weather touch [15]}
Your attentiveness to the whispers of the sky allows you to nudge the weather. This lets you alter the weather, with the effect occurring after 6 - \textlf{perception} skill days. 


\subsection{Wind-caller [12]}
A brief gust can be summoned through secret whispers to the wind. This spell reverses the flight of projectiles entering a target region for 1 round. 
\subsubsection{Augment: Howling winds [13]}
